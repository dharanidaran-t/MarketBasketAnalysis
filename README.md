# Market Baket Analysis
  * Market basket analysis is a data mining technique that analyzes patterns of co-occurrence and determines the strength of the link between products purchased together. We also refer to it as frequent itemset mining or association analysis.

# Data prerequisite:
  * For conducting market Baket Analysis approach to Machine Learning, I have collected secondary-data from a departmental store opposite to Pondicherry University (where majority of customers will be my college students and nearby local peoples in Kalapet).
  * In this study, market analysis application will be implemented at Quick-Pick Departmental Store (Near Pondicherry University Kalapet), in regard with its inability to use transaction data. This application is expected to work well and is able to generate the desired result.

# Objective

The objective of this study is to achieve the following:

1. To take the information from the super market and apply machine learning to predict what we need to do in the future.
2. To apply data analysis in our thesis. Where we will have our research process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data to discover useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
3. To apply data mining, We will be applying MBA approach to machine learning. There we will try to understand the customer's purchase behaviour.
